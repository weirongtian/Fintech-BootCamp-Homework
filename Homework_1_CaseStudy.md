## Business Activities:

### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Apple Pay is a digital wallet service which allows one party to make electronic transactions with another party to purchase goods and services. It provides an alternative way for consumers to make payment. It can be used both on line and in-peron. Money can be deposited in the digital wallet prior to any transactions or, in other cases, an individual's bank account can be linked to the digital wallet. 
In addition to the convenience it brings to consumers, it also solves the problem of information stealing. Even the cared issuing banks generally do a fantastic job of keeping their systems incredibly secure, the merchant may have the opportunity to see consumer’s number and store it in their systems. 

### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Apply Pay service treated almost everyone as customer, because every one needs to make payment or transfer in their daily life. Apple Pay is supported on the iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad and Mac, so everyone who owns Apple devices could utilize it.
It is now available in 60 countries. According to QUARTZ, Apple Pay accounts for about 5% of global card transactions.  While in terms of online payment process, it accounts for 0.13% market share based on data analyzed by Datanyze. 
Apple Pay is easy to use compared to its competitors. The biggest player in digital payment process, PayPal, allows individuals and businesses to transfer funds electronically. When making an in-store purchase, PayPal requires users to open the app, find the store and check-in. From there, users are given the option to order ahead at a restaurant and choose which account they'd like to pay with.While Apple Pay hasn't been rolled out to the masses All users have to do is position their device near a payment point at a store, using Touch ID or Face ID and they're good to go. A vibration and a beep will let users know the transaction was successful. There's no need to do anything else. It is can be used in the public transport networks such as Chicago Transit Authority’s Ventra or the New York MTA’s OMNY.

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? 
The service keeps customer payment information private from the retailer by replacing the customer's credit or debit card Funding Primary Account Number (FPAN) with a tokenized Device Primary Account Number (DPAN), and creates a "dynamic security code" generated for each transaction.The "dynamic security code" is the cryptogram in an EMV-mode transaction, and the Dynamic Card Verification Value (dCVV) in a magnetic stripe data emulation-mode transaction. Apple added that they would not track usage, which would stay between the customers, the vendors, and the banks. Users can also remotely halt the service on a lost phone via the Find My iPhone service.
